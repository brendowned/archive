This is the 8th of May, 2022.  I'm Eve, and this is a blog about my car Cassius. Or maybe not. 
  I would like to make one thing clear. My car is not cool. My car is not a sleeper, it isn't modded, it doesn't even have a proper system.
  This Camry has been broken into once under my care, and the thieves went through every inch and crevice of Cassius before determining absolutely nothing was of worth to steal, not even the stereo. This car has been smoked in, puked in, and maybe even peed in at some point.
I feel confident to say though that over time things have slowly and I mean <b>very slowly</b> started to improve.

I'm not a mechanic, an engineer, or even a proper car enthusiast. But I am an artist, and I aim to make the trashiest '04 Toyota Camry that North America has ever seen.  As to whether or not you believe who I am 
is up to you.  And whether or not you believe that this car
is going to be recycled or refurbished is up to you.  Now, the 
purpose of this text is to <b>warn</b> you that this vehicle is about to be driven around your area, 
and that it's going to happen very soon.
</p><p>
I hope that you take advantage of this.  I hope that I have 
been able to clear up what Cassius represents a little bit, and that you wont feel the need to egg my car when I drive by.
